July 11 - Sept. 8, 2012: lost data from the soil moisture and temperature sensors. Data was downloaded but lost on the laptop after download.	July 23, 2013: wind and hail storm damaged corn leaves and caused significant lodging. Soybean leaves were damaged as well. Some pictures of the corn were taken for future record.  In July there was a rainstorm that had high wind and hail at the Ames cover crop site. This damaged the corn and soybean plants. Soybean growth was stunted due to tissue defoliation and breaking off of growing points. Corn was just beginning the pollination stage, and plants were lodged and had tissue damage. Corn plants have since recovered to some extent from the lodging, but hail damage to the leaves, stalks, and ear shoots reduced plant biomass and light interception. In addition, hail damage to the ear shoot has allowed smut disease to infect some ears, eliminating grain production on those ears. The late summer conditions were quite dry and changed from cool temperatures to near record high temperatures. The dry and hot conditions will further reduce crop yield potential in the corn and soybean crops.  Fall 2013: Soil sampling could not be completed at all profile depths due to hard soil conditions (a result of the summer and fall drought)	Overall, a very wet growing season. This affected corn growth significantly. Plots 208W, 302W, 311W (corn) had poor growth all year due to prolonged saturated soils. Soybeans did somewhat better, but there was still a small stand loss due to excess water. Plots 302E, 308E, 410E.	1. Quite a lot of issues with the Decagon soil moisture sensors. Soil sensors would fail and dataloggers would not download data.  3. Reps 2 and 3 remained wet for a good portion of the growing season, especially in the corn.  5. Overall, corn yields were not maximized due to high wheel traffic and wet conditions. The #120 N rate did not produce the max. agronomic yields in corn.  6. Soybeans looked good all year, yield levels were good.

However, a mixture of pea (Pisum sativum L.) and turnips (Brassica rapa L.) with the seeding rate of 140 kg ha-1 was seeded by broadcasting method prior to growing soybean in 2013 after previous year corn. Thus, treatments tested in the on-farm experiment included soil with no-cover-crop (NCC) and soil with 1-year of cover-crop (CC) and triplicate soil samples were collected for each management practice. The NT plots received previous year’s crop-residues of 9.8 ± 1.8 Mg ha-1 and were grown to a winter cover crop. Dry granular N as fertilizer rate of 150 pounds acre.	No cover crop grown in 2014 and so no vegetation sampling in 2014 in this site was undertaken in 2014.
